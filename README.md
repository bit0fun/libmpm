# MultiPrecision Math Library
Current Version: 0.0.1

This C library provides a way to more precisely do arithmetic on computers.
Utilizing two main kinds of data types, being double fixed point and symbolic
numbers, speed and precision can be adapted to the use case. 

## To-Do List
In no particular order, each of the following will be accomplished for this
library. More will be added at some point in the future, but as this is in
early development, the following should constitute version 1 once finished.
### General
-[X] Setup Build Environment
-[ ] Configuration Settings

-[ ] Verify Speed, memory useage

### Double Fixed Point Specific
-[ ] Type Conversion Functions
-[ ] Arithmetic Functions
-[ ] Trigonometry Functions
-[ ] Add useful Constants to file
-[ ] Parallelization
-[ ] Tests for all functions

### Symbolic Specific
-[ ] Type Conversion Functions
-[ ] Arithmetic Functions
-[ ] Trigonometry Functions
-[ ] Add useful Constants to file
-[ ] Parallelization
-[ ] Tests for all functions

### Settings to add
-[ ] Maximum precision size
-[ ] Disable Symbolic (useful if only need one)
-[ ] Disable Double Fixed Point (useful if only need one)
-[ ] Enable Parallelization
-[ ] Enable GPU Parallelization (CUDA ?)
